# Bit-O-Asm-3

## Description

Can you figure out what is in the eax register? Put your answer in the picoCTF flag format: picoCTF{n} where n is the contents of the eax register in the decimal number base. If the answer was 0x11 your flag would be picoCTF{17}.

## Approach

For our 3rd dump we are given:

```text
<+0>:     endbr64
<+4>:     push   rbp
<+5>:     mov    rbp,rsp
<+8>:     mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x14],edi
<+11>:    mov    QWORD PTR [rbp-0x20],rsi
<+15>:    mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0xc],0x9fe1a
<+22>:    mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8],0x4
<+29>:    mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0xc]
<+32>:    imul   eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8]
<+36>:    add    eax,0x1f5
<+41>:    mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4],eax
<+44>:    mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4]
<+47>:    pop    rbp
<+48>:    ret
```

I'm going to focus on this section which puts data into `eax`

```text
<+15>:    mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0xc],0x9fe1a
<+22>:    mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8],0x4
<+29>:    mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0xc]
<+32>:    imul   eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8]
<+36>:    add    eax,0x1f5
<+41>:    mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4],eax
<+44>:    mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4]
```

We can write this bit of code mathematically as `eax = 0x9fe1a * 0x4 + 0x1f5`

Computing that gives us `0x27FA5D`. Then we can convert this to decimal to get the flag.
