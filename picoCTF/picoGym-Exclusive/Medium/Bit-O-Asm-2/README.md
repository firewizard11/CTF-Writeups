# Bit-O-Asm-2

## Description

Can you figure out what is in the eax register? Put your answer in the picoCTF flag format: picoCTF{n} where n is the contents of the eax register in the decimal number base. If the answer was 0x11 your flag would be picoCTF{17}.

## Approach

This time we have the following assembly

```text
<+0>:     endbr64
<+4>:     push   rbp
<+5>:     mov    rbp,rsp
<+8>:     mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x14],edi
<+11>:    mov    QWORD PTR [rbp-0x20],rsi
<+15>:    mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4],0x9fe1a
<+22>:    mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4]
<+25>:    pop    rbp
<+26>:    ret
```

We see at the end `DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4]` is put into `eax`.

If we look one line above we see `0x9fe1a` being moved into that address.

If we convert this to decimal we get `654874` which is our flag.
