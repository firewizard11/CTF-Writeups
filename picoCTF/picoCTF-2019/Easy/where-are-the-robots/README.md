# where are the robots

## Description

Can you find the robots?

## Approach

Navigating to the challenge site shows us a blank black page with the text "Welcome" and "Where are the robots?"

Given the whole robots vibe I'm going to go to the `robots.txt` page for the site which had 1 entry for a html page

Navigating to this hidden site will give us the flag!
