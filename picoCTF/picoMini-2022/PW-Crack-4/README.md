# PW Crack 4

## Description

Can you crack the password to get the flag? Download the password checker here and you'll need the encrypted flag and the hash in the same directory too.

## Approach

Just to be brief, we can see that this challenge is basically the same as [PW Crack 3](../PW-Crack-3/README.md)

We can just edit the existing script to iterate through each possible password until it finds the correct one in exactly the same way as the previous challenge.

Now when we run it we should get the flag
